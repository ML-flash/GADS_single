"""
GADS: Generative Adaptive Dynamical Systems.

A genetic algorithm whose alphabet is not fixed. The population searches over
base atoms plus a set of captured compositions called the Meta-Genome, and that
set is produced by the population itself. What a single mutation can reach
therefore depends on structure the search authored, and the coordinate system of
the search moves as the search proceeds.

ENCODING

A composition is its content, carried by value as an immutable tuple. Identity
is structural equality: two compositions are the same object when and only when
their content matches, at every depth. There is no identifier space for
compositions and no table mapping names to content.

Three properties follow from that choice rather than being implemented
separately. Nothing needs to resolve a reference, so there is no cache and no
admission policy. A composition is meaningful to any process that receives it
without a shared namespace, since it carries its own content. And a dying
composition can be folded into its parents by value, so death conserves
information instead of erasing it.

SUBSTRATE

Two delimiters, ENC_OPEN and ENC_CLOSE, plus the atoms supplied by the fitness
environment. Nothing else is given. Every composition is derived: insertion lays
down a matched delimiter pair, capture lifts the delimited span into a single
token, and that token can then be nested by the same route. All structure above
the atom is produced by boundary mechanics operating on the population.

PARTICIPATION

Every composition lives in one pool, and the census taken while decoding the
population is the whole test: a composition no organism used this generation is
removed. Nothing is counted and nothing is given a grace period. The census runs
before breeding and mutation, so what it establishes is that nothing held the
composition at the moment the population was scored, which is the evidence
deletion needs and the only evidence available locally.

A composition must therefore earn its own use. Nested compositions are invisible
to the census, since decode reports only what an organism holds at top level, so
a composition that has become part of a larger one is dissolved into it. Be
independently useful or be inlined into the context where you are useful.

One seam sits beside this rule without being part of it. A composition arriving
from another process is in nobody's hands, so a census that does not see it has
not established non-use, only that sampling was never given the chance to offer
it. age_enter takes a grace for that case and sweep honours it. Nothing in this
file passes one and no single node run reaches it; it is an adapter for
asynchronous parallel operation, and the number lives in run_network.

Meta-Genome size is not set anywhere. It self-sizes to the balance between
capture inflow and use-or-die pruning, which makes it a negative feedback loop:
a larger Meta-Genome spreads a roughly fixed service budget more thinly, so more
entries go unused.

DEATH AS INLINING

When a composition dies, every tracked structure referencing it is rewritten
with the dead child's contents spliced in place, and identical results are
merged. The decoded atomic content of a parent is unchanged by the death of its
child. Death changes granularity, not extension, so the representation can churn
continuously without losing information. The population is not touched;
organisms holding a dead structure continue to decode it correctly.

DECODE

Iterative over an explicit stack, so there is no depth limit and no recursion.
A composition's decoded atomic content is independent of how deeply it is
nested.

    The working alphabet above the atoms.

    mco holds the active compositions, keyed by the composition itself since a
    composition is its content. Insertion order is capture order, which is what
    sampling reads, and the key is the membership test, so one structure serves
    both accesses.

    The value is the arrival grace: how many further sweeps this entry survives
    unheld. It is zero for every composition the machine admits on its own,
    because capture lands a composition in an organism and the next census sees
    it held. A nonzero grace is an adapter for asynchronous parallel operation.
    See age_enter.

    Removal is decided by the census rather than by anything stored here.

    MG is not required to decode. decode() expands a composition from its own
    content and never consults this object's state, so an organism holding a
    composition that has been removed still decodes to the same atoms. What MG
    governs is the proposal distribution, through sample_composition, and
    whether open expands a composition or leaves it whole, through is_active.
    A near-empty MG therefore does not stall the machine; it removes the brake
    on expansion.

    A third structure, pending, carries rewrites back to the population.
    Inlining rewrites entries here and cannot touch organisms, since reaching
    into the population to edit tokens is the global controller the foundation
    derivation excludes. So an organism goes on holding a form this object has
    moved past. It still decodes to the same atoms and loses no fitness, but it
    expresses that content through a token no longer live, so it emits no usage
    signal and sampling cannot offer it.

    pending closes that without a search. When inlining rewrites old into new
    the pair is recorded here, and each organism collects what applies to it on
    the decode it was already performing.

    This is local in the sense the foundation derivation requires. The test is
    not whether population state is written, since mutation writes it every
    generation, but whether anything is used that the local site could not have
    had. Nothing is scanned, no model of the population is consulted, and no
    assumption about the problem is made. Decode already takes an encoding and
    returns a value; it now sometimes returns two, the decoded content and the
    current structural identity of what was presented. The organism receives
    only an answer about the token it supplied, on a channel that was already
    carrying data in both directions. It is a return value, not a push.

    Entries here are the one thing that still counts generations, because a
    rewrite is claimed by an organism rather than observed in one. A composition
    is judged by a census that sees the whole population at once; a rewrite is
    judged by whether anyone came to collect it. One evaluation pass decodes
    every organism, so a single generation is a complete pass over everybody who
    could hold the superseded form, and DB_THRESHOLD of one is that pass. A
    claim resets the count anyway, since claiming is decoding and an update
    still in service should not expire under an organism that has not reached
    it.

    Size is emergent. Nothing here bounds mco, and no constant sets a target
    size.
